### Story

_Crownless_ is set in a kingdom where kings rule for a hundred years.

During their reign, kings are completly invulnerable. And when their century of rule comes to an end, whoever deposes them becomes the next king.

You arrive in the kingdom just as the reign of a king is coming to an end. Various challengers to the king have begun to emerge. Who will become the next king? Is everything as it seems?

Development on the game started in the summer of 2018, and it's been going at a pretty slow and steady pace.

It's written in Lua using the LÃ–VE framework. Here's a list of the [tools used to make Crownless](/blog/tools-used-to-make-crownless).
