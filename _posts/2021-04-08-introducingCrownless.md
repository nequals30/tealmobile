Crownless is a mobile action/adventure platformer game in development for Android and iOS.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/assets/blog_images/crownless_snowRun.gif" width="40%" /></div>

It's set in a kingdom which is governed by a special rule:

Each king rules for 100 years, during which they are completly invulnerable. At the end of that time, whoever deposes the king becomes the next king.

You arrive in the kingdom just as the reign of King Annorax is coming to an end.
