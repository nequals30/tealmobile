### Story
It's set in a kingdom where kings rule for 100 years.

During their reign, they are completly invulnerable. And when those 100 years are over, their reign comes to an abrupt end — whoever deposes them becomes the next king.

You arrive in the kingdom just as the reign of King Annorax is coming to an end. Various challengers to the king have begun to emerge. Who will become the next king? Is everything as it seems?

### Development
Development on the game started in the summer of 2018, and it's been going at a pretty slow and steady pace.

This game is a solo project I'm making in my spare time, so I only have ~15 minutes at a time to work on it.

It's made using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) framework.
