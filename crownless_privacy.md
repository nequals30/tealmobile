# Privacy Policy
_Last updated 2023-12-09_

Crownless doesn't __store any personal information, at all, in any way__.

### Information Collection and Use

The following points outline the data practices for the game:

* __Personal Data Collection and Storage__: Personal data is neither collected nor stored. Crownless is developed using the [LÃ–VE Framework](https://love2d.org/), which, to the best of the developer's knowledge, does not collect personal data. Gameplay progress and settings are exclusively stored locally on the user's device.

* __Data Usage__: Since the game is a single-player experience operating locally, there is no use of user data for any online purposes.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

Updates to this privacy policy may occur periodically. Users are advised to review this document for any changes. New privacy policies will be effective immediately upon their posting here.

### Contact

For questions or suggestions regarding this privacy policy, please reach out to [the developer](https://github.com/nequals30).
