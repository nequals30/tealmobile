Tealmobile Games is a one-man game development project.

I am currently working on [Crownless](/crownless), a mobile action / adventure / Metroidvania platformer for iOS and Android.

I aspire to make quality mobile games with quality content. I'd like to see more mobile games at a flat price without ads and in-app purchases, and that's how I plan to release my games.

I use open source tools to make everything; I will write a blog post about that soon.

Game development is something I'm doing in my free time, outside of my day job, so please be patient if my updates are infrequent.
