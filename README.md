# Teal Mobile Games Website

This is the repo for the Teal Mobile games website, which can be found here:
[http://www.nequals30.github.io/tealmobile](http://www.nequals30.github.io/tealmobile)

This site is hosted on Github pages and built using Jekyll.

The theme is a modified version of [Cayman Blog](https://github.com/lorepirri/cayman-blog) by [Lore Pirri](https://lorepirri.gitlab.io/), and that's built on top of [Cayman Theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman).
